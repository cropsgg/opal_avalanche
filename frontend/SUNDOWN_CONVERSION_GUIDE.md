# Sundown Studio - TSX + Tailwind CSS Conversion

## Overview
I've successfully converted the Sundown Studio HTML/CSS/JS website to a modern React TypeScript application using Tailwind CSS. The conversion maintains all the original animations and interactive features while making it more maintainable and component-based.

## Components Created

### 1. `/app/sundown/page.tsx`
Main page component that orchestrates all the sections.

### 2. `/components/sundown/Loader.tsx`
- Animated loading screen with sequential word animations
- Uses Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Shows "ENVIRONMENTS", "EXPERIENCES", "CONTENT" with gradient text

### 3. `/components/sundown/Hero.tsx`
- Navigation bar with hover effects
- Large hero title "SPACES THAT INSPIRE"
- Animated floating blobs in the background
- Video background
- Responsive design for mobile

### 4. `/components/sundown/MovingText.tsx`
- Infinite horizontal scrolling text
- Shows "EXPERIENCES • CONTENT • ENVIRONMENTS" repeatedly
- Smooth CSS animation with Tailwind

### 5. `/components/sundown/About.tsx`
- About section with animated text and image
- Intersection observer for scroll-triggered animations
- Animated background blob
- Responsive layout

### 6. `/components/sundown/Projects.tsx`
- Interactive project list with hover effects
- Fixed image that follows mouse cursor
- Orange overlay animations on hover
- Project data with company and category information

### 7. `/components/sundown/Services.tsx`
- Swiper carousel for services
- Company logos and descriptions
- Horizontal scrolling cards
- Auto-width slides

### 8. `/components/sundown/Footer.tsx`
- Fixed footer with animated background
- Newsletter signup form
- Social links
- Large "Sundown" text
- Animated gradient blobs

## Features Implemented

### Animations
- ✅ Loading sequence with timed word animations
- ✅ Floating background blobs with custom keyframes
- ✅ Infinite scrolling text
- ✅ Hover effects on navigation and project items
- ✅ Mouse-following project images
- ✅ Scroll-triggered animations using Intersection Observer

### Interactions
- ✅ Project hover effects with overlays
- ✅ Navigation button hover states
- ✅ Interactive carousel/swiper
- ✅ Smooth transitions between states

### Responsive Design
- ✅ Mobile-first approach
- ✅ Breakpoint-specific layouts
- ✅ Scalable text and spacing
- ✅ Touch-friendly interactions

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Component-based architecture
- ✅ Lazy loading with React
- ✅ Optimized animations with Framer Motion
- ✅ Efficient re-renders

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 13.5.1
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Carousel**: Swiper.js
- **Scroll Detection**: react-intersection-observer

## Custom Tailwind Configuration

Added custom animations and keyframes:
```typescript
animation: {
  'move': 'move 10s linear infinite',
  'gooey': 'gooey 6s ease-in-out infinite alternate',
  'footergooey': 'footergooey 5s ease-in-out infinite alternate',
}
```

## Assets Setup
- Copied all images, videos, and fonts from original project
- Configured font-face declarations for Neue Haas Display
- Set up proper asset paths for Next.js public folder

## How to Use

1. **Development**: The app is running at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Navigate to Sundown**: Click "View Sundown Studio Demo" button or go to `/sundown`
3. **All interactions work**: Hover over projects, scroll through sections, use the carousel

## Key Differences from Original

### Improvements
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- **Component Reusability**: Modular component architecture
- **Better Performance**: React optimizations and lazy loading
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Modern Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, hot reload

### Preserved Features
- **Visual Identity**: Exact same design and colors
- **Animations**: All original animations recreated
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile design maintained
- **Interactions**: All hover effects and dynamics

## File Structure
```
app/sundown/page.tsx           # Main page
components/sundown/
├── Loader.tsx                 # Loading animation
├── Hero.tsx                   # Hero section with nav
├── MovingText.tsx            # Scrolling text
├── About.tsx                 # About section
├── Projects.tsx              # Interactive project list
├── Services.tsx              # Services carousel
└── Footer.tsx                # Animated footer
public/sundown-assets/         # All images, videos, fonts
```

The conversion is complete and fully functional! The website now uses modern React patterns while maintaining the exact visual appearance and smooth animations of the original design.
