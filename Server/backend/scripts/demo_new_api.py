OPAL Server API Demo Script

Demonstrates the new document-focused API endpoints:
1. Hash multiple documents and preview costs
2. Notarize documents on subnet with gas fee tracking
3. Verify notarization and retrieve audit data

This script shows the enhanced workflow where the server
handles all gas fees and provides comprehensive cost tracking.

LEGAL OPINION MEMORANDUM

TO: Chief Technology Officer
FROM: Legal Department
DATE: January 20, 2024
RE: Open Source Software Licensing Compliance

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This memorandum analyzes the intellectual property implications
of incorporating open source components into our proprietary
software products.

ANALYSIS

1. License Compatibility
The proposed Apache 2.0 and MIT licensed components are
compatible with our commercial distribution model.

2. Copyleft Concerns
GPL-licensed components must be carefully evaluated to avoid
unintended copyleft obligations on proprietary code.

3. Attribution Requirements
All open source components require proper attribution in
documentation and software notices.

4. Patent Implications
Apache 2.0 license provides explicit patent grants, reducing
risk of patent litigation from contributors.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Implement license scanning in CI/CD pipeline
2. Maintain comprehensive attribution documentation
3. Avoid GPL components in core proprietary modules
4. Establish regular license compliance reviews

This opinion is based on current law and industry practices.
Consult legal counsel for specific implementation questions.
